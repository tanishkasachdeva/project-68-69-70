        </center>Swami Sant Dass Public School has been an epitome of excellence since April 2000. We have been inching towards perfection. Perfection, being an abstract concept, keep us agile and diligent. We are privileged to nurture the future with utmost zeal. For us every child is unique. The positive ambience of the school coupled with magnificent infrastructure as well as enthusiastic members of the staff widens the horizon of the students. The mentor and the mentee share a strong bond in our school. Swami Sant Dass Ji, the prophet and scintillating Saint had strong belief, determination and dedication to serve humanity and to do memorable service to the cause of education. Placing this ideal as a touchstone Mahamandaleshwar Swami Ishwar Dass Ji Shastri moulded himself as an emissary to establish a shrine of knowledge as his service to the society and humanity at large. Thus the institution that brings alive the ethical credo of these great saints was founded in April 2000 with a vision of igniting the minds of children. A separate Junior Wing constructed as per the requirement is functioning successfully. The eternal flame shall continue to shine on the forth coming generations under the able guidance, missionary zeal and sweeping vision of Mahamanaleshwar Swami Shantanand Ji. His never ending thirst for education, the dream to empower and liberate young mindsand the spirit of courage and grit are the factors that motivate us to carry the great tasks ahead. With all the nurturing by our committed, co-operative management and dedicated staff, we promise to keep aloft high ideals laid by the harbingers of the institution.
